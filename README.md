# Post Data Using useSWR with React

This repo is a smiple example on how to post data using the `swr` mutation. This is just a simple example and I am hoping to add more details and documentation to it.

## Dependencies

1. useSWR  - [https://swr.vercel.app/]()
2. Axios       - [https://axios-http.com/]()

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
